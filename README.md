**Scenario**
<br>
Adventure Works, a multinational bicycle manufacturer, has multiple sales operations across the globe. The company’s executive board and sales management team require quarterly sales information to assess their performance for the previous quarter. This analysis should provide them with the insights they need to make strategic decisions for their upcoming quarter.

As a data storyteller, the specific tasks you should perform in this exercise are:

Create a data story through a dashboard, providing an overview of quarterly sales performance for the executive board of Adventure Works.

Create a granular report with interactivity about the same sales period for the sales management team.

Highlight any trends identified, such as higher/lower sales by region, category, and salespersons.

Provide a conclusion summarizing the key takeaways for both the board of directors and sales management team.
